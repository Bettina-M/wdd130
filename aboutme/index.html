    <h2>Tina</h2>
    <p>Hi, My name is Bettina from Nairobi Kenya, most people have a hard time pronouncing my name,
    so they mostly call me Tina.I have been married for the last 5 years and have a wonderful 19 month
    old daughter (she is very energetic!).
    I am also a Latter Day Saint and love the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>I'm a Customer Support Specialist while at the same time persuing a degree in Software Development.
    It's always been a dream of mine to learn coding and build different softwares for everyday use.
    It's exciting that i'll be able to fullfill my dreams through the BYU online program.</p>
    <P>I love baking, taking nature walks and spending time with my family. I look forward to 
    getting to know all of you and reading about you. 
    Thanks for taking the time to view my webpage.</P>
